# PICO-8-collection
A collection of the games I make for PICO-8, a fantasy game console!

# What games?
- QuackQuest 0.1 (quackquest.p8)
- Invaders from Space 0.1 (SI.p8)
- Invaders from Space REBOOT (ifs.p8)

All games in this collection are made by myself and will more than likely always be in an unfinished state. Sorry T_T

# How to run these games
### Locally
If you wish to run them locally you need Pico-8! You can learn more about it [here](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).
Once Pico-8 is running type the following:
- LOAD NAMEOFGAME
- RUN (or press ctrl+r)

Once the game is loaded you can always press escape to make your own changes to the code, art, music and whatever else!

### Web
If you don't own Pico-8, go [here](http://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?uid=9693&mode=carts) and play them in your browser without having to install any plugins!

# How are they played
Arrowkeys to move, Z and X are action buttons. What they do depend on the game you are playing.
