# PICO-8-collection
A collection of the games I make for PICO-8, a fantasy game console!

# How to run these games
First, you need Pico-8! You can learn more about it [here](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).
Once Pico-8 is running type the following:
- LOAD NAMEOFGAME
- RUN (or press ctrl+r)

Once the game is loaded you can always press escape to make your own changes to the code, art, music and whatever else!

# How are they played
Arrowkeys to move, Z and X are action buttons. What they do depend on the game you are playing.
